        <p>Vikram Ambalal Sarabhai was an Indian physicist and astronomer who is regarded as the father of India's space program. 
            He was born on August 12, 1919 in Ahmedabad, India and died on December 30, 1971.Son of Ambalal Sarabhai, he came from the famous Sarabhai family from India who were major industrialists committed to the Indian independence movement. 
            Vikram Sarabhai married the classical dancer Mrinalini in 1942. The couple had two children. His daughter Mallika gained prominence as an actress and activist, and his son Kartikeya too became an active person in science. 
            During his lifetime, he practiced Jainism.He attended Gujarat College, Ahmedabad, but later moved to the University of Cambridge, England, where he took his tripos in natural sciences in 1940.
            In 1945 he returned to Cambridge to pursue PhD and wrote a thesis, “Cosmic Ray Investigations in Tropical Latitudes,” in 1947</p>

      <p>Sarabhai was a pioneer in the field of space science in India and played a key role in establishing the Indian space program. 
        He founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad in 1947, which became one of the leading centers for space research in India. 
        He also played a key role in establishing the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in 1969, which is now the primary government agency responsible for India's space program.
        Known as the cradle of space sciences in India, the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) was founded in 1947 by Vikram Sarabhai.[8] PRL had a modest beginning at his residence, the "RETREAT", with research on cosmic rays.

        The institute was formally established at the M.G. Science Institute, Ahmedabad, on 11 November 1947[9] with support from the Karmkshetra Educational Foundation and the Ahmedabad Education Society. Prof. Kalpathi Ramakrishna Ramanathan was the first Director of the institute. The initial focus was research on cosmic rays and the properties of the upper atmosphere. Research areas were expanded to include theoretical physics and radio physics later with grants from the Atomic Energy Commission. He led the Sarabhai family-owned business conglomerate.
        His interests varied from science to sports to statistics. He set up the Operations Research Group (ORG), the first market research organization in the country. Most notable among the many institutes he helped set up are the Nehru Foundation for Development in Ahmedabad, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA), the Ahmedabad Textile Industry's Research Association (ATIRA) and the (CEPT). Along with his wife Mrinalini Sarabhai, he founded the Darpana Academy of Performing Arts. Other projects and institutions initiated or established by him include the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) in Kalpakkam, Variable Energy Cyclotron Project in Calcutta, Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) in Hyderabad and Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) in Jaduguda, Jharkhand. 
        Sarabhai started a project for the fabrication and launch of an Indian satellite. 
        As a result, the first Indian satellite, Aryabhata, was put in orbit in 1975 from a Russian cosmodrome.
        He was the founder of Indian Space Research Organisation.</p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2><hr>
      <p>Sarabhai's contributions to the development of India's space program have made him an important figure in the history of science and technology in India. He is remembered for his vision and leadership in establishing India's space program, as well as for his contributions to the fields of science and technology. Today, the ISRO continues to build on his legacy and is one of the leading space organizations in the world.</p>
